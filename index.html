                    Green walls, or vertical gardens, are structures covered with 
                    plants that grow on specialized frameworks, usually attached 
                    to a building's exterior or interior. These walls incorporate 
                    soil or substrate layers, irrigation systems, and often hydroponic 
                    setups to support plant growth. They are eco-friendly solutions for
                     urban areas, as they reduce noise, enhance insulation, improve air
                      quality, and promote biodiversity by creating habitats for birds,
                       insects, and small animals. Green walls also help manage stormwater,
                        lower energy costs, and provide cooling effects, thus contributing
                         to sustainability and aesthetic value in urban spaces, aligning
                          with corporate social responsibility and environmental goals.

                <div class="tab-contents" id="Hackathons">
                    Canopies are overhead structures that provide coverage and shade, 
                    typically in outdoor or semi-enclosed spaces. Often constructed 
                    from materials like wood, metal, or fabric, they support plant 
                    growth and integrate irrigation systems for sustained greenery.
                     Green canopies are common in urban designs for walkways, alleys,
                      and plazas, as they create microclimates by lowering surrounding
                       temperatures, filtering sunlight, and increasing humidity. 
                       By reducing heat, absorbing carbon, and promoting biodiversity,
                        they benefit both environmental and human health. Canopies also 
                        add visual appeal, foster community spaces, and support sustainable
                         architecture, blending natural and built environments to enhance
                          city landscapes and climate resilience.
                </div>
                <div class="tab-contents" id="Ecosystem">
                    An ecosystem on green walls and canopies consists of an interconnected network
                     of plants, microorganisms, insects, and sometimes small animals that create a 
                     self-sustaining environment. Plants, such as ferns, mosses, grasses, and 
                     flowering species, form the base by photosynthesizing and producing oxygen.
                      This greenery provides food and shelter for insects like bees, butterflies,
                       and beetles, which aid pollination. Soil or substrate layers contain
                        beneficial bacteria and fungi, breaking down organic material and supporting 
                        nutrient cycling for healthy plant growth.

                    Irrigation systems keep moisture levels optimal, allowing plants to thrive and,
                     in turn, regulate humidity. These mini-ecosystems absorb carbon dioxide, 
                     mitigate urban heat, improve air quality, and manage rainwater. As habitats,
                      they increase biodiversity and offer environmental benefits by mimicking 
                      natural ecosystems on a smaller scale in urban environments. Together, 
                      these elements create a balanced, resilient system that supports both life 
                      and environmental sustainability.
